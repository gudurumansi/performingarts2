    <h1>Oggu Katha</h1>
    <p class ="intro=paragraph">Oggu Katha, also known as Oggukatha, is a traditional folkloric practice involving singing and narrating stories of Hindu deities such as Mallana, Beerappa, and Yellamma. Originating within the Kuruma (Kuruba) and Yadava communities, it centers around the praise of Lord Shiva, particularly Mallikarjuna. Devotees, often from the Kuruma and Yadava communities, travel from one location to another, sharing tales of their caste gods. Oggus, the traditional priests of the Yadavas, play a crucial role, conducting ceremonies like the marriage of Mallanna with Bhramaramba.</p>
