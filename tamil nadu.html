    <h1>Terukkuttu</h1>
    <p class ="intro=paragraph">Terukkuttu is a traditional Tamil street theatre practiced in Tamil Nadu, India, and Tamil-speaking regions of Sri Lanka. It serves as entertainment, ritual, and social instruction. Themes often revolve around Tamil versions of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, with a focus on characters like Draupadi. The terms Terukkuttu and Kattaikkuttu are sometimes used interchangeably today, though historically they distinguished between mobile processional performances (Terukkuttu) and overnight narrative performances at fixed spaces (Kattaikkuttu).</p>
