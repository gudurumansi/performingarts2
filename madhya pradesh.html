                    <h3>Geographical Variations</h3>
                <p>Maach is thought to have originated from Rajasthan's khyal folk theatre, linked to the development of nautanki in Uttar Pradesh and svang in Haryana. An alternative theory traces its roots to turra kalangi troupes from Rajasthan, who, in the 18th and 19th centuries, introduced maach to Central India. Over time, it transformed into a staged performance, incorporating new stories, songs, dance, and characters.</p>
