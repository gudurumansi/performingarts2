    <h1>Yakshagana</h1>
    <p class ="intro=paragraph">Yakshagana is a traditional theater form originating in Karnataka's coastal regions, integrating dance, music, dialogue, costume, make-up, and stage techniques. Also known as "Aata," it evolved during the Bhakti movement and exists in two forms: Thenku thittu in the south (Dakshina Kannada to Kasaragod) and Badaga thittu in the north (Udupi to Uttara Kannada). Traditionally performed from dusk to dawn, Yakshagana draws its stories from Hindu, Jain, and other ancient Indic traditions, portraying narratives from epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. </p>
