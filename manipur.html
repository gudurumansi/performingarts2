    <h1>Shumang Kumhei</h1>
    <p class ="intro=paragraph">Shumang Kumhei, also known as Shumang Leela, is a traditional Meitei theatre form performed in Manipur, North East India. Originating during monarchical rule, it took a proper form in 1895 A.D. The open-air theatre involves male actors, some portraying female roles. Present-day performances address moral values, unity, and brotherhood, fostering community bonds. In 2017, Shougrakpam Hemanta received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, marking a significant recognition for his contribution to Shumang Leela.</p>
